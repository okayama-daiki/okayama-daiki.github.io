Since you are ambitious, you want to do it in one night, but as you walk into the first pub next door you notice that you do not have a map of the city. Luckily, on one wall you find a list of some of the closest pubs with information how far away they are and how to get there. As you are assured, such a list is available in every pub of the city, so you decide to conduct your quest by using only the information on these lists. Of course, you want to minimize the total distance you have to walk during your endeavor, but, after all, how much could a map help if you have these lists? Probably not too much, right?"
